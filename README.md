# CPP Module 05 - Form and Bureaucrat

## Overview
This module introduces the concept of **Forms** and **Bureaucrats** in C++, focusing on class implementation, validation, and exception handling.

## Key Topics
- **Form Class**: Managing form creation and validation logic.
- **Bureaucrat Class**: Implementing a class that handles the submission of forms and interacts with other objects.
- **Exception Handling**: Using custom exceptions for validation errors.
- **Operator Overloading**: Overloading operators to compare objects and manage interactions.

## Notes
- It seems to me exception throwing and returning error fulfill the same function, maybe 1 day i will realise what is the difference (some companies advise not to use exception throwing).
